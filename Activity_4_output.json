  "abstract": "This paper investigates the utilization of quantum algorithms to improve interstellar navigation systems. By leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement, our proposed navigation system can calculate optimal travel paths through space-time anomalies more efficiently than classical methods. Experimental simulations suggest a significant reduction in travel time and fuel consumption for interstellar missions.",
